`API::Discord` is a Perl6 module for interacting with the Discord API. Built on top of [`Cro::WebSocket::Client`](https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket) and [`Cro::HTTP::Client`](https://github.com/croservices/cro-http), this allows for fast asynchronous operations between your application and the API.
